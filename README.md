<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the documentation for the data and scripts used in my paper on *Nostoc* phylogenetics, evolution and species boundaries. The manuscript is currently in prep.

You can access the tutorial for placing unknown *Nostoc* sequences within our phylogenomic framework [here](this is being built...).

## Table of Contents

## 1. How to use this guide

## 2. Computational and software setup

The analyses for this project were run on three different machines:

- [**Duke Computer Cluster**](https://oit-rc.pages.oit.duke.edu/rcsupportdocs/dcc/) (~85% of tasks): Runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and uses the SLURM scheduler to distribute tasks.
- **iMac Pro** (~5% of tasks, mostly DiscoVista): Runs macOS V XX, Radeon Pro XX processor, 120 GB RAM.
- **MacBook Pro** (~10% of tasks, mostly R): Runs macOS Ventura 13.6.3. Apple M1, 8 Gb RAM.

I am working on containerizing all the software I used. For now, you can install things individually following the instructions in the next sections.

### 2.1 Conda environments (including R)

I exported all conda environments as YAML so you can use the exact same version and dependencies I ran. You can install each environment individually:

- [BUSCO](https://busco.ezlab.org/)
    ```sh
    # Create and install BUSCO environment
    conda env create -f conda_env_yamls/busco.yml
    # Download BUSCO lineage datasets for cyanobacateria and nostocales
    mkdir busco_downloads
    mkdir busco_downloads/lineages
    wget https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/cyanobacteria_odb10.2021-02-23.tar.gz

        --coefficients 'https://zenodo.org/record/5819401/files/PlasX_coefficients_and_gene_enrichments.txt.gz'
    ```
- [PopCOGenT](https://github.com/philarevalo/PopCOGenT)
    ```sh
    # Create conda environment with (most) dependencies
    conda env create -f conda_env_yamls/popcopgent.yml
    # Clone PopCOGenT repoâ€“There are no releases, I cloned it at commit 7296af9
    git clone https://github.com/philarevalo/PopCOGenT.git
    cd PopCOGenT/
    conda activate PopCOGenT
    # Install required version of Infomap, distributed with popcogent
    cd Infomap/
    make
    # Download mugsy
    cd ../
    wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/mugsy/files/mugsy_x86-64-v1r2.3.tgz/download
    mv download mugsy_x86-64-v1r2.3.tgz
    tar xvzf mugsy_x86-64-v1r2.3.tgz
    cd ../ 
    ```
- [Anvio](https://anvio.org/install/)
    ```sh
    # Create conda environemtn with dependencies

    # Install anvio using pip
    conda activate anvio-7.1
    curl -L https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/releases/download/v7.1/anvio-7.1.tar.gz \
        --output ./anvio-7.1.tar.gz
    pip install ./anvio-7.1.tar.gz
    # After this is done, you will likely get an error that looks like [issue #1830](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/issues/1839). The code below should fix it
    cp $(conda info --base)/pkgs/python-3.6.13-h12debd9_1/lib/python3.6/_sysconfigdata_x86_64_conda_linux_gnu.py \
     $(conda info --base)/envs/anvio-7.1/lib/python3.6/_sysconfigdata_x86_64_conda_linux_gnu.py
    ```
    I always ran anvio from our cluster, but I set up a port to get the interactive sessions on Chrome in my local computer. [Check out this post that explains how to do it](https://merenlab.org/2018/03/07/working-with-remote-interative/).
- **R 4.2.2** For increased reproducibility, I have R as conda environment and used [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#collaboration) to manage R packages. To reproduce my R environment, make sure that you have cloned the repository or downloaded the files `renv.lock`, `.Rprofile`, `renv/settings.dcf`, and `renv/activate.R`. If you are using a version of R other than 4.2.2, you can install the conda environment with R 4.2.2:

    ```sh
    # Create conda environment with R 4.2.2 and renv
    conda env create -f conda_env_yamls/r_422.yml
    # Activate R conda environment and start R
    conda activate r-4.2.2
    R
    ```
    If you are already running R 4.2.2, you can skip the step above and launch R from the directory where you cloned the repository and renv should automatically bootstrap itself, downloading and installing the appropriate version of renv. Then, within R, you can restore all packages in the project library from the lock file:
    ```R
    renv::restore()
    ```
    You will be asked to confirm that you want to install all the packages. Type "y" and proceed. The installation may take a while. After this, you can use this conda environment to run any of the R scripts. 

### 2.2 Software with pre-compiled binaries

These software have precompiled binaries. I used all of these programs on the cluster, but most of them have binaries available for macOS as well.

    ```

### 2.3 Software to build from source

These programs need to be compiled from source.

- [wASTRAL-hybrid](https://github.com/chaoszhang/ASTER/blob/master/tutorial/astral-hybrid.md)
    ```sh
    wget https://github.com/chaoszhang/ASTER/archive/refs/heads/Linux.zip
    unzip Linux.zip
    cd ASTER-Linux/
    make & cd ../
    ```

    tar xf paml4.9j.tgz
    rm paml4.9j.tgz
    cd paml4.9j/
    rm bin/*.exe
    cd src
    make -f Makefile
    ls -lF

    tar xzvf master.tar.gz
    cd berkeleylab-metabat-*
    #run the installation script
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. [ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install ] && make && make test && make install
    ```

### 2.4 Docker containers

The only program that I used as a container was [DiscoVista](https://github.com/esayyari/DiscoVista). I was not able to get this running on the cluster, so I installed it on the MacBook Pro and the iMac Pro. It worked well on both. You will need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for this to run. Then do:

```sh
docker pull esayyari/discovista
```

## 4. Phylogenetic analyses (Figure 1 and related supplements)

### 4.1 Inference of phylogenetic trees

#### 4.1.1 Extraction of phylogenetic markers

The majority of the markers that we used in the study are from the [OrthoDB](https://www.orthodb.org/) (**nostocales_odb10**) which is used by BUSCO. Therefore, we first run BUSCO on the genomes to extract those markers with the script [busco_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/busco_set103.sh):

```sh
sbatch scripts/busco_set103.sh
```
Next, we sort the sequences to generate one file for each one of the markers with the sequences from all taxa (in nucleotide and amino acid). The output files will be written to `analyses/phylogenetics/set103/seqs`. The script is [sort_busco_seqs_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/sort_busco_seqs_set103.sh):

```sh
sbatch scripts/sort_busco_seqs_set103.sh
```
We also included the **16S** and ***trnL*** markers. To extract those, we first annotate the *Nostoc* genomes with Prokka and then use the annotation to extract and compile the 16S and *trnL* sequences. The scripts are [prokka_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/prokka_set103.sh), [get_16s_from_ffn_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/get_16s_from_ffn_set103.sh), [get_trnl_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/), and [compile_trnl_16s_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/compile_trnl_16s_set103.sh):

```sh
# Annotate set 103 genomes with Prokka
sbatch scripts/prokka_set103.sh
# Get 16s from annotated genomes set8 FIX THIS TO ACCOUNT FOR MULTIPLE AND PARTIAL HITS
sbatch scripts/get_16s_from_ffn_set103.sh
# Get trnl from annotated assemblies for set103
sbatch scripts/get_trnl_set103.sh
# Compile 16s and trnl seqs. I removed 16S from Nostoc_KVJ2.fa because it wasn't nostoc
sbatch scripts/compile_trnl_16s_set103.sh
```
Now, all the sequences in ### are ready to be aligned.


#### 4.1.2 Alignments

For the BUSCO loci, we first align the amino acid sequences using mafft-dash. The script is [mafft_set103_aa.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/mafft_set103_aa.sh):

```sh
mkdir -p analyses/phylogenetics/set103/alignments/single
sbatch scripts/mafft_set103_aa.sh 
```

Then, we use pal2nal to backtranslate the amino acid alignment to nucleotide. The script is [pal2nal_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/pal2nal_set103.sh):

```sh
sbatch scripts/pal2nal_set103.sh
```

Now, we trim the sites with gaps from the alignment using trimAl and then remove some of the characters that trimAl adds to the sequence headers. The scripts are [trimal_ng_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/trimal_ng_set103.sh) and [fix_headers_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/fix_headers_set103.sh):

```sh
# Trim gaps from alignments
sbatch scripts/trimal_ng_set103.sh
# Remove trimal crap from headers
sbatch scripts/fix_headers_set103.sh
```

Next, we summarize nucleotide alignment features to filter out loci with < 200 variable sites and < 136 (90%) taxa. After filtering, we kept 1517 genes. The scripts are [summarize_na_alignments_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/summarize_na_alignments_set103.sh) and [filter_busco_ids_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/filter_busco_ids_set103.sh):

```sh
# Summarize single gene alignments after trimming
mkdir -p analyses/phylogenetics/set103/alignments/sumaries
sbatch scripts/summarize_na_alignments_set103.sh
# Filter busco ids to remove loci with < 200 variable sites and < 136 (90%) taxa
sbatch scripts/filter_busco_ids_set103.sh
```

Finally, we get codon partitions for all 1517 protein coding genes. The script is [get_codon_partition_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/get_codon_partition_set103.sh):

```sh
sbatch scripts/get_codon_partition_set103.sh
```

I aligned the **16S** and ***trnL*** manually and the alignment files are under `analyses/phylogenetics/set103/alignments/single/`. All alignments are now ready for single-locus ML tree inference.

#### 4.1.3 Gene trees

We now infer ML gene trees using IQ-Tree. The scripts are [ml_gene_trees_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/ml_gene_trees_set103.sh) and [ml_16s_trnl_trees_set103](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/ml_16s_trnl_trees_set103):

```sh
mkdir -p analyses/phylogenetics/set103/trees/single
sbatch scripts/ml_gene_trees_set103.sh
sbatch scripts/ml_16s_trnl_trees_set103.sh
```
The trees will be under `analyses/phylogenetics/set103/trees/single/*.treefile`.

When there are identical sequences, IQ-Tree removes duplicates from the analyses and adds them aafter the search and bootstrap and they are attached to their identical match with a branch length of 0. The new internodes from this attachments have empty bootstrap values. We need to replace those empty values with 100 for the conflict analyses. The script is [replace_empty_ufboot_single_set103.R](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/replace_empty_ufboot_single_set103.R):

```sh
Rscript scripts/replace_empty_ufboot_single_set103.R
```

The cleaned gene trees are now under `analyses/phylogenetics/set103/trees/single/*noempty.treefile`.

#### 4.1.4 Species trees â€“ wASTRAL and concatenated ML (Figure S1A and S1B)

We use the 1519 gene trees to infer a coalescent species tree with weighted-ASTRAL. **This is the tree that we used for Figure S1A**. The script is [wastral_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/wastral_set103.sh):

```sh
sbatch scripts/wastral_set103.sh
```
Next, we concatenate all 1519 aligments and infer a ML tree. **This is the tree that we used for Figure S1B**. The scripts are [concatenate_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/concatenate_set103.sh), [get_codon_partition_concat_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/get_codon_partition_concat_set103.sh), [concat_pf_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/concat_pf_set103.sh), and [concat_tree_set103.sh](https://github.com/cjpardodelahoz/nostoc/blob/main/scripts/concat_tree_set103.sh): 

```sh
# Concatenate sequences
sbatch scripts/concatenate_set103.sh
# Get codon partition file for the concatenated alignment
# Remember to remove the codon lines for 16s and trnl
sbatch scripts/get_codon_partition_concat_set103.sh
# Find best partition scheme and models
sbatch scripts/concat_pf_set103.sh
# ML searach and bootstrapping
sbatch scripts/concat_tree_set103.sh
```
